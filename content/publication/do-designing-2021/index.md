abstract: The use of virtual and augmented reality for educational purposes has seen
  a rapid increase in interest in recent years. Extended reality offers unique affordances
  to learners, and can enhance learning. Speciﬁcally, we are interested in the use
  of pedagogical agents in extended reality due to their potential to increase student
  motivation and learning. However, the design of pedagogical agents in extended reality
  is still a nascent area of study, which can be important in an immersive environment
  where social cues can be more salient. Pedagogical agent design aspects such as
  speech, appearance, and modality can prime social cues and affect learning outcomes
  and instructor perception. In this paper, we propose a project to investigate auditory
  and visual social cues of pedagogical agents in XR such as speech, ethnicity, and
  modality.
