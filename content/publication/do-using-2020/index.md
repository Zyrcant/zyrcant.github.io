abstract: League of Legends (LoL), one of the most widely played computer games in
  the world, has over 140 playable characters known as champions that have highly
  varying play styles. However, there is not much work on providing champion recommendations
  to a player in LoL. In this paper, we propose that a recommendation system based
  on a collaborative ﬁltering approach using singular value decomposition provides
  champion recommendations that players enjoy. We discuss the implementation behind
  our recommendation system and also evaluate the practicality of our system using
  a preliminary user study. Our results indicate that players signiﬁcantly preferred
  recommendations from our system over random recommendations.
