abstract: 'Training simulations in virtual reality (VR) have become a focal point
  of both research and development due to allowing users to familiarize themselves
  with procedures and tasks without needing physical objects to interact with or needing
  to be physically present. However, the increasing popularity of VR training paradigms
  raises the question: Are VR-based training assessments accurate? Many VR training
  programs, particularly those focused on inspection tasks, employ simple pass or
  fail assessments. However, these types of assessments do not necessarily reflect
  the userâ€™s knowledge.'
