abstract: Matching avatar characteristics to a user can impact sense of embodiment
  (SoE) in VR. However, few studies have examined how participant demographics may
  interact with these matching effects. We recruited a diverse and racially balanced
  sample of 78 participants to investigate the differences among participant groups
  when embodying both demographically matched and unmatched avatars. We found that
  participant ethnicity emerged as a significant factor, with Asian and Black participants
  reporting lower total SoE compared to Hispanic participants. Furthermore, we found
  that user ethnicity significantly influences ownership (a subscale of SoE), with
  Asian and Black participants exhibiting stronger effects of matched avatar ethnicity
  compared to White participants. Additionally, Hispanic participants showed no significant
  differences, suggesting complex dynamics in ethnic-racial identity. Our results
  also reveal significant main effects of matched avatar ethnicity and gender on SoE,
  indicating the importance of considering these factors in VR experiences. These
  findings contribute valuable insights into understanding the complex dynamics shaping
  VR experiences across different demographic groups.
