abstract: In many consumer virtual reality (VR) applications, users embody predefined
  characters that offer minimal customization options, frequently emphasizing storytelling
  over user choice. We explore whether matching a user's physical characteristics,
  specifically ethnicity and gender, with their virtual self-avatar affects their
  sense of embodiment in VR. We conducted a 2 Ã— 2 within-subjects experiment (n=32)
  with a diverse user population to explore the impact of matching or not matching
  a user's self-avatar to their ethnicity and gender on their sense of embodiment.
  Our results indicate that matching the ethnicity of the user and their self-avatar
  significantly enhances sense of embodiment regardless of gender, extending across
  various aspects, including appearance, response, and ownership. We also found that
  matching gender significantly enhanced ownership, suggesting that this aspect is
  influenced by matching both ethnicity and gender. Interestingly, we found that matching
  ethnicity specifically affects self-location while matching gender specifically
  affects one's body ownership.
