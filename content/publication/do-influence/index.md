abstract: Using the VALID Avatar Library, we created 14 mixed-gender avatars by combining
  facial features from male and female avatars within seven racial categories. In
  an online study (n=68), the avatars were perceived as racially ambiguous, despite
  source avatars sharing the same race. Same-race participant analysis showed nuanced
  ambiguity reduction, emphasizing categorization refinement. Findings suggest a potential
  link between gender and race perception, influenced by limited perceptual expertise.
