abstract: We present an immersive virtual reality (VR) application that is designed
  to train users in recycling behaviors. In this demonstration, users play a recycling
  game in which they are awarded for proper recycling procedures. The application
  provides users with visual and auditory feedback as well as various interaction
  cues. Prior research shows that VR experiences can influence behavior in the physical
  world and can be particularly powerful in behavior modification. This application
  aims to transfer real recycling behaviors to participants and can be used to study
  the effects of VR on behavior modification.
