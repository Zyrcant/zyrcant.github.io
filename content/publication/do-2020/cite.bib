 abstract = {We present an immersive virtual reality (VR) application that is designed to train users in recycling behaviors. In this demonstration, users play a recycling game in which they are awarded for proper recycling procedures. The application provides users with visual and auditory feedback as well as various interaction cues. Prior research shows that VR experiences can influence behavior in the physical world and can be particularly powerful in behavior modification. This application aims to transfer real recycling behaviors to participants and can be used to study the effects of VR on behavior modification.},
