      text: |
        I am especially passionate about diversity in computing. Previously, I have served as a mentor for the **ACM-Women (2020-2022)** chapter at UCF. I cofounded and currently serve as the **External Vice-President of [Girls Who Code @ UCF](https://www.instagram.com/girlswhocodeucf/)**. Due to my love for coding, I also lead the technical interview prep group at GWC@UCF to help prepare our brilliant club members for industry jobs. See below for some of my workshop materials:
        <br><br>[Introduction to Git and GitHub](uploads/GitWorkshop.pdf)
        <br>[Introduction to Technical Interviews - Practice Problems](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XBoCPR-FSeRVGuCvlFEm2kATrp76KzEF?usp=sharingf)<br><br> 
        
        Additionally, I have served as an external reviewer for the following journals and conferences: Springer Virtual Reality (2021), ACM MM (2021, 2022), IEEE VR (2022, 2024), ACM CHI (2022, 2023, 2024), IEEE ISMAR (2022).
