☕️ I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science, specializing in Human-Centered AI, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and virtual avatars. My research focuses on the potential of AI to personalize experiences for individuals, placing a premium on their unique identities and perspectives. I aim to create AI systems and virtual avatars that enable people to explore diverse identities and experiences.

Previously, I conducted research at Microsoft Research and Google, where I focused on user experience (UX) and interactions with language applications, particularly large language models (LLMs) and virtual agents. My work examines how identity intersects with and impacts user perceptions and interactions.

As the proud daughter of a Vietnamese refugee family, I go by both my American name, Tiffany, and my native name, Diễm. I am very active in diversity in computing organizations, which you can find more about in service. In my freetime, I enjoy drawing (check out my [gallery!](https://zyrcant.artstation.com/)), playing tennis, and drinking copious amounts of green tea.
