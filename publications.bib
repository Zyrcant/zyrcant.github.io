  abstract = {Using the VALID Avatar Library, we created 14 mixed-gender avatars by combining facial features from male and female avatars within seven racial categories. In an online study (n=68), the avatars were perceived as racially ambiguous, despite source avatars sharing the same race. Same-race participant analysis showed nuanced ambiguity reduction, emphasizing categorization refinement. Findings suggest a potential link between gender and race perception, influenced by limited perceptual expertise.},

  abstract = {In many consumer virtual reality (VR) applications, users embody predefined characters that offer minimal customization options, frequently emphasizing storytelling over user choice. We explore whether matching a user's physical characteristics, specifically ethnicity and gender, with their virtual self-avatar affects their sense of embodiment in VR. We conducted a 2 {\texttimes} 2 within-subjects experiment (n=32) with a diverse user population to explore the impact of matching or not matching a user's self-avatar to their ethnicity and gender on their sense of embodiment. Our results indicate that matching the ethnicity of the user and their self-avatar significantly enhances sense of embodiment regardless of gender, extending across various aspects, including appearance, response, and ownership. We also found that matching gender significantly enhanced ownership, suggesting that this aspect is influenced by matching both ethnicity and gender. Interestingly, we found that matching ethnicity specifically affects self-location while matching gender specifically affects one's body ownership.},
